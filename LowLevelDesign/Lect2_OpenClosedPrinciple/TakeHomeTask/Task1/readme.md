Got it. Here’s what each file up through DiscountCalculator does and how they collaborate:

⸻

1. DiscountStrategy.java

public interface DiscountStrategy {
double applyDiscount(double price);
}

	•	Purpose: Defines the abstraction for any discount rule.
	•	Key idea: Anything that knows how to compute a discount must implement this interface.
	•	OCP role: New discount behaviors are added by creating new implementations—no change to existing code.

⸻

2. ElectronicsDiscount.java and ClothingDiscount.java

public class ElectronicsDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
@Override
public double applyDiscount(double price) {
return price * 0.10;
}
}

public class ClothingDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
@Override
public double applyDiscount(double price) {
return price * 0.20;
}
}

	•	Purpose: Concrete strategies. Each encapsulates the specific discount percentage for a product category.
	•	They implement DiscountStrategy and provide their own applyDiscount logic.

⸻

3. Product.java

public class Product {
private final double price;
private final DiscountStrategy discountStrategy;

    public Product(double price, DiscountStrategy discountStrategy) {
        this.price = price;
        this.discountStrategy = discountStrategy;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public double calculateDiscount() {
        return discountStrategy.applyDiscount(price);
    }
}

	•	Purpose: Represents a product with a price and an associated discount policy (strategy).
	•	Behavior: When asked for its discount, it delegates the calculation to whatever DiscountStrategy it was composed with.
	•	Decoupling: Product doesn’t know the details of the discount, only that the strategy can compute one.

⸻

4. DiscountCalculator.java

public class DiscountCalculator {
public double calculateDiscount(Product product) {
return product.calculateDiscount();
}
}

	•	Purpose: Client that requests the discount for a given product.
	•	Responsibility: It doesn’t contain any branching or type logic; it simply asks the product to provide its discount.
	•	OCP compliance: It never needs to change when new product types or discount rules are added.

Flow up to DiscountCalculator
1.	A concrete DiscountStrategy (e.g., ElectronicsDiscount) defines how to compute a discount.
2.	A Product is created with a price and one of these strategies.
3.	DiscountCalculator.calculateDiscount(product) calls product.calculateDiscount().
4.	Product delegates to its DiscountStrategy, which returns the computed discount.

At this point, everything is extendable (you can add new strategies) without modifying Product or DiscountCalculator—fulfilling the Open/Closed Principle.
